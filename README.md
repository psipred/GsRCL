## GsRCL

This method adopts a Gaussian noise-augmented single-cell RNA-seq contrastive learning approach, where it exploits the well-known Gaussian distribution to create views for self-supervised contrastive learning. It is designed for cell-type identification tasks, such as reference-query tasks, where we use the reference to annotate the unknown cells in the query. For simplicity, no pre-processing or genes selection is required, the query genes expression matrix should have raw counts or log-transformed counts (i.e. log(1 + count)). We break the task into several binary classification tasks. We cross reference the query genes against the reference genes. If more that 50% of the genes match, we obtain a set of probabilities for each query cell, where each probability is associated with a cell type in the selected reference. However, if the number of matching genes is less than or equal 50%, we suggest selecting a different reference.

## AF-RCL

This method adopts an augmentation-free single-cell RNA-Seq contrastive learning approach, where it conducts supervised contrastive learning on the original cells without any augmentation. It is designed for cell-type identification tasks, such as reference-query tasks, where we use the reference to annotate the unknown cells in the query. For simplicity, no pre-processing or genes selection is required, the query genes expression matrix should have raw counts or log-transformed counts (i.e. log(1 + count)). The task is treated as a multi-class classification task. We cross reference the query genes against the reference genes. If more that 50% of the genes match, we obtain a set of probabilities for each query cell, where each probability is associated with a cell type in the selected reference. However, if the number of matching genes is less than or equal 50%, we suggest selecting a different reference.

## Usage 

The below commands apply to both GsRCL and AF-RCL.

Step 1: Verify the input file

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py \
-i [the full path to the input file] \
-o [Default='.' - the full path to the output directory] \
-r [the name of the reference] \
-t [transpose the matrix if rows are genes and columns are cells] \
-mp [the full path to the reference directory] \
-mat [Optional - the key to the matrix object] \
-obs [Optional - the full tree to the observations object, i.e rows]
```

Step 2: Obtain predictions

``` bash
python gsrcl_predict.py \
-o [Default='.' - the full path to the output directory] \
-r [the name of the reference] \
-t [transpose the matrix if rows are genes and columns are cells] \
-mp [the full path to the reference directory] \
-p [Default=0.5 - select a p-value cut-off for putative new cell types] \
--log [log transform the input matrix if it contains raw counts] 
```

### Examples
Here we provide some examples that apply to both GsRCL and AF-RCL, where the file gsrcl_predict.py can be replaced with the file afrcl_predict.py

#### Example 1

Log-transform the input matrix without transposing it and use the Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle reference to obtain predictions, where default values are used.

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i [INPUT FILE] -r Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] -t 0
```
``` bash
python gsrcl_predict.py -r Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] --log 1 -t 0
```

#### Example 2

Transpose the input matrix without log-transforming it and use the Adam reference to obtain predictions, where p-value is set to 0.7.

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i [INPUT FILE] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] -t 1
```
``` bash
python gsrcl_predict.py -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] -p 0.7 --log 0 -t 1
```

#### Example 3

Same as Example 2 but set the output directory.

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i [INPUT FILE] -o [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIR] -t 1
```
``` bash
python gsrcl_predict.py -o [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] -p 0.7 --log 0 -t 1
```

#### Example 4

Same as Example 3 but with providing the keys to the h5 objects in the tree, where the required objects at depth 1 in the tree.

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i [INPUT FILE] -o [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIR] -t 1 -mat exprs -obs obs_names -var var_names
```
``` bash
python gsrcl_predict.py -o [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] -p 0.7 --log 0 -t 1
```

#### Example 5

Same as Example 4 but the required objects at depth 2 in the tree. The keys should be space delimited. 

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i [INPUT FILE] -o [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIR] -t 1 -mat X -obs obs barcode -var var feature_name
```
``` bash
python gsrcl_predict.py -o [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] -p 0.7 --log 0 -t 1
```

Example 6

Same as Example 4 but the obs object at depth 2 and the var object at depth 3 in the tree. The keys should be space delimited. 

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i [INPUT FILE] -o [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIR] -t 1 -mat matrix -obs matrix barcodes -var matrix features id
```
``` bash
python gsrcl_predict.py -o [PATH TO OUTPUT DIR] -r Adam -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] -p 0.7 --log 0 -t 1
```

## Output

There are two output files, the first is probabilities.csv that shows a set of probabilities for each query cell, where each probability is associated with a cell type in the selected reference. Each query cell is annotated based on the cell-type with the highest probability, however, if the highest probability is less than or equal to the p-value, the cell is annotated as “Unassigned” to consider new cell types. The second file is tsne.svg that shows a scatter plot of a 2D projection of the query matrix using t-SNE. It also illustrates the annotations in the first file.

The scripts creates four intermediary files with type .npy that should be deleted 
after the output is presented.

## Reference file structure

Given the below file structure, the -mp argument for GsRCL should be set as -mp …/GsRCL and for AF-RCL should be set as -mp …/AFRCL

```

|   -- Reference 1
|   |      |
|   |      -- Encoder files
|   |      -- SVM files
|   |      -- Ref genes
|   |
|   -- Reference 2
|          |
|          -- ...

### Sample h5 files for testing

#### File name: sample1.h5 (Unknown organ)

Case 1: Try to read the file without setting the optional arguments.

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i …/sample1.py -r Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle -mp [PATH TO REFERENCE DIRECTORY] -t 0
```

Output:

TBC

Case 2: Based on the printed tree, provide space delimited keys for the -obs and -var arguments. 

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i …/sample1.py -r Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle -mp ./data/-t 0 -obs matrix barcodes -var matrix features name
```

Output:

TBC

Case 3: Based on the error message, the name object has duplicates, hence we replace it with the id object

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i …/sample1.py -r Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle -mp ./data/ -t 0 -obs matrix barcodes -var matrix features id
```

Output:

TBC

None of the query genes match the selected reference, where the reference’s organ is Mouse Limb Muscle.

Case 1: Try to read the file without setting the optional arguments.

``` bash
python verify_hdf.py -i …/sample2.py -r Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle -mp ./data/ -t 0
```

Output:

``` bash 
The file verified successfully.
```

Case2: Try to obtain the probabilities without setting the p-value.

``` bash
python .verify_hdf.py -i ./sample2.h5 -r Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle -mp ./data/ -t 0 -obs obs cell_type1 -var var_names
```

``` bash
python ./src/gsrcl_predict.py -o ./ -r Quake_Smart-seq2_Limb_Muscle -mp ./data/ -p 0.7 --log 0 -t 0
